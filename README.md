- Most of the rides are taken during working days and there's a dip in the number of rides on weekends.
- The distribution of rides duration for subscribers of the service is consistent  and mostly centered around the center of the duration distribution among different stations while for customers it's not which suggests that customers don't have fixed rides and they use the service occasionally for different purposes. 
- Men have overall shorter ride durations than women
- Subscribers have overall shorter ride durations than customers which confirms the above claims
- The number of subscribers rides during the working days is higher and dips for weekends but there's no trend among the days for customers
- Subscribers rides follow the bimodal distribution of rides per hour which shows that most rides are at 8 and 17 and it shows that during working hours the rides dip quite significantly and although the customers rides follow the same bimodal distribution the rides during working hours are still high and doesn't dip as much as for subscribers which means that there's a descent amount of customers that occasionally use the service for other non-routine rides even during working hours.
